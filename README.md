## Med Cabinet for new cannabis consumers, especially those trying to get off of pharmaceuticals, who want to use cannabis as a means to battle medical conditions and ailments.  Our aim is to help patients find the right strains. Use user data along with strain data to build ML models to guide recommendations.


## As one of groups for creating Med Cabinet Project, we DS students work on:

```sh
* Source and analyze data to better understand the reported effects of different cannabis strains/types.

* Create a model to predict which strains/types a user would enjoy based on their input (desired effects). Can use any techniques you wish.

* Make the recommendations accessible to the rest of the team via a Flask API or equivalent.
```

## Instructions for Usage the Flask API:
